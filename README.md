# H_TOOLS
H_TOOLS is a toolkit designed for hacking and hardware experimentation. It includes tools for M5StickC Plus 2, card readers, Flipper devices, and other hardware platforms. Perfect for penetration testing, security research, and IoT projects. All in one convenient package.  NOTE: Not all files in this toolkit are created by me. Use at your own risk.
